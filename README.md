- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GitLoriRouleau

I'm learning about Git and work with companies who hire software developers.  I want to learn more about the Software Development process....   I took some coding classes
in college,  but honestly it took me hours and hours to get "hello world" to show up on the screen so I could pass the lab!

I'm in awe of people who can fly thru code!  

Happy to be here and learning by getting my hands dirty!
